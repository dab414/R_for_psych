# R for Psych

*Fall 2018*

This is a repository containing materials for a grad seminar that I'm leading on how to use R for analyzing psychological data, with aspirations that it might one day turn into a youtube video series.

Content will become available in the repository as we progress through the material throughout the term.

See the [overview](Quantitative%20Things%20Overview.pdf) for more information.
