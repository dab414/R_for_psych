topics to cover in week 1:

	workspace environment
		working directory n stuff

	basic calculator operations and assignment

	basic data structures 
		vectors and dataframes
		creation and indexing
			indexing is very tricky when encountering it for the first time

	maybe reading in simple data and doing basic things
		like summary statistics or coding / trimming variables

	the basics of how to work with functions
		what arguments are, inputs and outputs

sample datasets:
	library(MASS)
	data() # return a list of all datasets, there are a lot

maybe the session will culminate in having to index a dataframe to run a t-test
	i like the ToothGrowth data
